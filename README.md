# TicTacToe
This is a project that I created this past year for my Data Structures and Algorithm course. It's an interactive tic tac toe game between a human (user) and computer.

Paramaters
---------
The game ends and outputs the final outcome in the following situations:
* 😀 The next move ensures that the user wins
* 🤖 The next move ensures that the computer wins
* 🤝 The current move has led to a draw.

Development Environment
---------
Eclipse IDE and IntelliJ IDE were used in the project.
